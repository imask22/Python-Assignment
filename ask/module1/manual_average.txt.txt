r=s=t=5	 	#taking values in the variables
avg = r+s+t/3 	#this is what we suppose to do by                         		#programming

Step 1:
Replacing var with constants:
Step 2:(with sub steps denoting how the flow of program is)
avg = 5 + 5 + 5 / 3  (using left to right rule by the operator 			of same priority)
avg = 5 + 5 + 1.67
avg = 10+1.67
avg = 11.67 ...approx 

Step 3:
Answer = 11.67
